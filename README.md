This is a funny decision engine.
The user selects a few checkboxes which rappresent his priorities reguarding a decision and the websites gives a sarcastic answer, criticizing the priorities of the user.
This project is made to be funny. 
It helped me expirience with logic, having multiple input values and styling.
Overall it was a really fun project and i enjoyed writing the responses.
